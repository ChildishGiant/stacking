A FOSS clone of [3 Tiles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tile.master.connect.matching.game) but without all the horrible ads and in-app purchases.

Grids of tiles are stacked on top of eachother, offest 50%. To clear a tile it needs no tiles above it on any corners. You have a rack that tiles get placed into and once 3 matching tiles are in the rack, they get cleared. In the mobile game the rack is 7 tiles but this can be adjusted for difficulty.

Puzzles need to be generated backwards, top up, so that they are always solveable.
